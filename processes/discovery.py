# @brief Peer discovery module for SLCP (Simple LAN Chat Protocol)
#
# This module implements the decentralized peer discovery mechanism used by the SLCP chat application.
# It uses UDP broadcasting to detect other clients on the same network via `JOIN`, `WHO`, and `KNOWUSERS` messages.
# One process takes the role of a WHO responder and provides a list of all known clients upon request.
#
# The discovery process is run in a separate process and periodically sends discovery messages to update the local peer list.

# @brief Get the local machine's IP address.
#
# This utility function connects to a known external IP (Google DNS) to determine the outbound interface.
# If no connection is possible, falls back to loopback.
#
# @return A string representing the local IP address.

# @brief Main discovery process function.
#
# This function is designed to run in its own multiprocessing process. It listens and sends UDP broadcasts
# to discover peers on the network. It maintains a list of active peers by interpreting SLCP commands like:
# - `JOIN` (a peer has joined),
# - `LEAVE` (a peer has left),
# - `WHO` (a peer is asking who is online),
# - `KNOWUSERS` (a reply containing known peers).
#
# One client that successfully binds to the discovery port acts as the WHO responder.
# The process listens to a control pipe for termination.
#
# @param config A shared dictionary (Manager.dict) containing client configuration and a shared peer list.
#        Required fields: `handle`, `port`, `whoisport`, `peers`.
# @param ctrl_pipe A multiprocessing pipe used by the main process to send control signals (e.g., "STOP").
